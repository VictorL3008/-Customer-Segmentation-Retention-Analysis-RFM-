## 📌 Project Overview
In the highly competitive e-commerce sector, acquiring a new customer is **5 to 25 times more expensive** than retaining an existing one. This project analyzes transactional data from a UK-based online retailer (2009-2011) to identify customer segments and develop targeted retention strategies.

Using the **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** technique, I segmented the customer base to answer critical business questions:
* Who are our most valuable customers?
* Which high-value customers are at risk of churning?
* How can we personalize marketing campaigns to maximize ROI?

## 💼 Business Problem
The marketing team struggled with a "one-size-fits-all" email strategy, resulting in low engagement and high churn rates among VIP clients. They needed a data-driven approach to:
1.  Identify "At Risk" customers before they leave.
2.  Reward loyal customers to increase Lifetime Value (LTV).
3.  Optimize marketing budget by targeting the right audience.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Python (Pandas/NumPy):** Data cleaning, preprocessing, and RFM score calculation.
* **Power BI:** Interactive dashboard for stakeholders and final visualization.
* **DAX:** Custom measures for dynamic churn risk calculation.

## 🔍 Key Findings & Insights
Based on the analysis of **5,261 unique customers**:

* **⚠️ Revenue at Risk:** Identified **$119 Million** in potential revenue loss from high-value customers who haven't purchased in the last 6 months (Segments: *At Risk* and *Hibernating*).
* **🏆 The "Champions" Paradox:** While Champions generate the highest revenue per user, a significant portion shows signs of declining frequency.
* **📉 Inactive Base:** Approximately **20-30%** of the customer base has become inactive, signaling a need for an immediate reactivation campaign.

## 📊 Dashboard Features
The Power BI report includes:
1.  **Customer Engagement Matrix:** A scatter plot visualizing the relationship between Recency and Frequency.
2.  **Revenue Contribution Treemap:** Highlights which segments drive the most revenue.
3.  **Actionable List:** A filtered table allowing the marketing team to download specific customer IDs for email campaigns.
